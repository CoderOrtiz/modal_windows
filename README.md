# Modal Windows
Learning about Modal Windows and Keypress Events

## Description:

On this code along project, we learned how to create Modal Windows and how to use Keypress Events. For this project I did not deviate from the content as this is the first time I have worked with Modal Windows and my knowledge of Keypress Events is still in its infancy stage.

## What I learned: 

I learned in order to utilize Modal Windows you must have a good understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS, and JavaScript. I revisited "classList.add/remove", which is used to add and remove classes that are used within the HTML and CSS files.

Reference Keypress Events, I learned how to write a Keypress Event with logic, how to call a specific function with a specific key press. As well as how to target a specific class repeatedly utilizing a For Loop. All topics within this lesson are still new to me and I look forward to incorporating them in future projects to become more comfortable with them.
